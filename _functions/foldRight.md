# `foldRight`

~~~ scala
trait Collection[A] {
  def foldRight[B](z: B)(op: (A, B) â‡’ B): B
}
~~~

`foldRight` traverses the collection going *from right to left* taking both the
currently iterated element and a previous computed result as operands for the
binary operator `op`.
The "previous result" for the first time `op` is applied is provided by the
initial value `z`.

The computed result of `foldRight` is the result of the `op`'s last application.

On empty collections, `foldRight` doesn't apply `op` and the initial value `z`
is directly returned.
